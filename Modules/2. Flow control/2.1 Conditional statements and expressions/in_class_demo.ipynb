    "# What is Flow Control\r\n",
    "So far, we have been writing simple programs that haven't had much structure. We only execute code in sequential a order and we dont really have control over when certain statements get executed or the ability to do things in iteration. In most cases, you aren't writing code simply to just evaluate values, or check the type of a variable, or perform some type of calculation. Most of the times we want to actually *do* something with your program. This is where *flow control* or *the flow of the program* comes in. \r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "**Flow control is what allows for our program to have a useful structure so that more complex tasks can be executed.**\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Some things that allow us to control the flow of our program are:\r\n",
    "* Condition statements (choice)\r\n",
    "* Loop statements (iteration)\r\n",
    "* Break statements (stopping iterations)\r\n",
    "* Continue statements (continuing iterations)\r\n",

    "In this challenge, you are taksed with creating the hangman game in python. The goal is to write some code that allows the user to continue guessing words until they are able to guess the word that the computer has chosen. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Expectations\n",
    "- use the predefined `get_word()` function to generate a random word\n",
    "- give the user an amount of attempts equal to the length of the word +3\n",
    "- create an empty list that will hold the guesses that the user has made\n",
    "- during each guess the user is expected to either enter a single character (all lowercase), or the entire word if they think they know what it is.\n",
    "- if the user guesses a letter that has already been guessed, they should be told that they've already guessed that letter and their number of attempts should not be decreased.\n",
    "- Each time the user guesses a letter, print out a string with underscores where letters havent been guessed yet and characters from the word where it has been **(for example. p_th_n if the user has correctly guessed these letter in the word python)**"
